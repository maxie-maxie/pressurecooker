# pressurecooker
Never have to pay for video upload limits again, **pressurecook** videos to your preferred size, **using FFmpeg**.

Uses Vulkan for GPU Detection, supports **NVIDIA NVENC, AMD VCE, Intel QuickSync**. Through a simple command-line interface, pressurecooker calculates a video and audio bitrate budget from the source duration. It reports the finished size and warns when the output exceeds the target. Encoder rate control and container overhead can cause the result to differ from the requested size.

## Quick start

Install Python 3.10+, Git, and [FFmpeg with ffprobe](#requirements). Keep FFmpeg and ffprobe on PATH, then clone the repository:

```text
git clone https://github.com/maxie-maxie/pressurecooker.git
cd pressurecooker
```

Install and encode a video with a 25 MiB target.

Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install .
.venv/bin/pressurecooker video.mp4 output.mp4 -t 25
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install .
.\.venv\Scripts\pressurecooker.exe video.mp4 output.mp4 -t 25
```

Replace `video.mp4` with your file. Use `--help` to list flags.

## Requirements

| Dependency | Required for |
| --- | --- |
| FFmpeg and ffprobe | Every installation; installed separately. |
| Python 3.10 or newer | Python package and portable executable. Native executables include Python. |
| GPU and driver with Vulkan Video encoding support | GPU encoding. Software encoding remains available. |

The CLI has no third-party Python runtime dependencies. The FFmpeg build must contain the selected encoder: `libx264`, `libx265`, or `libsvtav1` for software; `h264_vulkan`, `hevc_vulkan`, or `av1_vulkan` for GPU encoding. Check `ffmpeg -encoders` for the available encoders. Vulkan Video uses the GPU's video hardware through its driver; support depends on the device, driver, and codec. General Vulkan graphics support alone is insufficient.

Software AV1 requires an FFmpeg build with SVT-AV1 two-pass integration; older builds may include the encoder without supporting two passes.

Install FFmpeg with your system package manager, for example:

```bash
# Debian or Ubuntu
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

```powershell
# Windows
winget install --id Gyan.FFmpeg --exact
```

Check that both commands resolve:

```text
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -version
```

Use `--ffmpeg` and `--ffprobe` to provide explicit executable paths.

## Installation

The Python distribution is named `pressurecooker-video` and installs the `pressurecooker` command. With [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) installed, install the release from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pressurecooker-video/):

```text
pipx install pressurecooker-video
pipx ensurepath
```

Open a new terminal after `pipx ensurepath`, then run `pressurecooker --help`. FFmpeg and ffprobe must be installed separately. Source installations and release files are described below.

### Python package

To install a source checkout, clone the repository as shown in [Quick start](#quick-start), then run these commands from its root.

Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install .
pressurecooker --help
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install .
.\.venv\Scripts\pressurecooker.exe --help
```

For an installation managed by pipx:

```text
pipx install .
pipx ensurepath
```

Open a new terminal after `pipx ensurepath`. A built wheel can also be installed with `pipx install pressurecooker_video-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`, or with `python -m pip install` inside a virtual environment.

### Native executable

Choose a file for your operating system and architecture. Keep its accompanying `.licenses` directory when redistributing it.

Linux x64, after building or extracting the release files:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin" "$HOME/.local/share/pressurecooker/licenses"
install -m 755 dist/pressurecooker-0.1.0-linux64 "$HOME/.local/bin/pressurecooker"
cp -R dist/pressurecooker-0.1.0-linux64.licenses/. "$HOME/.local/share/pressurecooker/licenses/"
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
pressurecooker --version
```

Add the `export PATH` line to your shell's startup file to keep this setting.

Use the `linux32` files for a 32-bit Linux installation, replacing `linux64` in these commands.

Windows x64, from the repository root after building:

```powershell
$installDir = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA 'Programs\pressurecooker'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $installDir -Force | Out-Null
Copy-Item -LiteralPath '.\dist\pressurecooker-0.1.0-windows64.exe' -Destination (Join-Path $installDir 'pressurecooker.exe')
Copy-Item -LiteralPath '.\dist\pressurecooker-0.1.0-windows64.licenses' -Destination (Join-Path $installDir 'licenses') -Recurse -Force
$userPath = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path', 'User')
if (($userPath -split ';') -notcontains $installDir) {
    $newUserPath = if ($userPath) { $userPath.TrimEnd(';') + ';' + $installDir } else { $installDir }
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('Path', $newUserPath, 'User')
}
if (($env:Path -split ';') -notcontains $installDir) {
    $env:Path = $env:Path.TrimEnd(';') + ';' + $installDir
}
pressurecooker --version
```

Use the `windows32` files for a 32-bit installation. The commands above rename the executable to `pressurecooker.exe` and update the user PATH without replacing existing entries.

### Portable executable

The `.pyz` file runs on a system with Python 3.10 or newer:

```text
python pressurecooker-0.1.0.pyz --help
```

On Linux, it can also be copied to a directory on PATH as `pressurecooker` and made executable with `chmod +x`. Its shebang uses `python3`.

## Release files

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pressurecooker_video-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl` | Python package for either interpreter architecture. |
| `pressurecooker_video-0.1.0.tar.gz` | Source distribution, including tests and build scripts. |
| `pressurecooker-0.1.0.pyz` | Portable executable; requires Python. |
| `pressurecooker-0.1.0-windows64.exe` | Native Windows x64 executable. |
| `pressurecooker-0.1.0-windows32.exe` | Native Windows x86 executable. |
| `pressurecooker-0.1.0-linux64` | Native Linux x64 executable. |
| `pressurecooker-0.1.0-linux32` | Native Linux x86 executable. |
| `*.licenses/` | License texts accompanying each native executable. |
| `pressurecooker-0.1.0-windows*.zip`, `pressurecooker-0.1.0-linux*.tar.gz` | Native executable with its license directory. |
| `SHA256SUMS` | SHA256 hashes of the built release files. |

FFmpeg and ffprobe are external dependencies for every release file. Native executables must be built on the target operating system with a matching interpreter architecture.

## Usage

```text
pressurecooker <source-video> <destination> --target-mb N [options]
```

Sizes use MiB; bitrates use kbps. The destination can be a directory or an output filename ending in `.mp4`, `.mkv`, or `.webm`. A directory receives `<sourceName>.fit<N>.<container-ext>`. A path without a recognized extension is treated as a directory.

Relative paths resolve against the current working directory. For example, from a Windows directory containing percent signs:

```powershell
Set-Location -LiteralPath 'D:\Rar%44211323%'
pressurecooker video.mp4 . -t 150
```

Encode H.264/AAC in MP4 for broad playback compatibility, including Discord clients that support that format:

```text
pressurecooker input.mov output.mp4 -t 25 -c h264 -s hd
```

Preview commands without creating output files or directories:

```text
pressurecooker video.mp4 output/ -t 50 --dry-run
```

## Options

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-t`, `--target-mb N` | Required | Positive, finite target size in MiB. |
| `-c`, `--codec C` | `hevc` | `h264`, `hevc`, or `av1`. |
| `-f`, `--container C` | Extension, then `mp4` | `mp4`, `mkv`, or `webm`; WebM requires AV1. |
| `-p`, `--preset P` | `fast` | Named encoder preset; AV1 also accepts 0-13. |
| `-a`, `--audio-kbps N` | `128` | Positive audio bitrate for re-encoding. |
| `-r`, `--fps N` | Source | Positive frame rate, up to 1000. |
| `-s`, `--resolution R` | Source | Resolution alias or `WxH`. |
| `-q`, `--hw M` | `auto` | `auto` or `vulkan`: detect Vulkan Video GPUs; `off`: software; `qsv`: legacy backend. |
| `-d`, `--dry-run` | Off | Print the plan and FFmpeg commands. |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | Off | Display FFmpeg progress. |
| `-ff`, `--ffmpeg PATH` | PATH | FFmpeg executable path. |
| `-fp`, `--ffprobe PATH` | PATH | ffprobe executable path. |
| `--overwrite` | Off | Replace an existing destination after successful encoding. |
| `--version` | | Print the version. |
| `-h`, `--help`, `/?` | | Show help. |

An explicit container must agree with the destination's recognized extension. Use `--` before positional paths whose names begin with a hyphen.

## Encoding behavior

### Presets and scaling

Named presets are `ultrafast`, `superfast`, `veryfast`, `faster`, `fast`, `medium`, `slow`, `slower`, `veryslow`, and `placebo`. Software H.264 and HEVC use these names directly. For SVT-AV1 they map to 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3 respectively.

Vulkan uses FFmpeg's `-quality` option. `fast` and faster presets map to level 0; `medium`, `slow`, `slower`, `veryslow`, and `placebo` request levels 1 through 5. AV1 numeric presets map to `max(0, 8 - N)`. The requested level is capped at the GPU's highest supported level. Higher levels trade speed for quality, with the available levels defined by the driver. The encoding plan reports the selected level and GPU.

Resolution aliases are `sd`/`360p` (640x360), `hd`/`720p` (1280x720), `fullhd`/`1080p` (1920x1080), `qhd`/`1440p` (2560x1440), and `uhd`/`2160p` (3840x2160). Explicit dimensions round down to even numbers. Requests exceeding either source dimension keep the original resolution. Frame rate stays unchanged unless requested.

### Audio and size budget

The first video and first audio streams are used. Compatible AAC audio in MP4/MKV, or Opus in WebM, is copied when its bitrate is known and at most 160 kbps. Other audio is re-encoded as AAC or Opus, with a minimum of 48 kbps and a cap based on 15% of the total budget. Video-only sources reserve no audio budget.

```text
total_kbps = target_MiB * 8388.608 / duration
video_kbps = floor((total_kbps - audio_kbps) * 0.97)
```

A video budget below 50 kbps is rejected. Software encoding uses two passes. GPU encoding uses one pass with an additional 0.96 bitrate factor. MP4 output includes `faststart`.

The default `auto` mode probes the GPUs listed by FFmpeg and selects the first that can encode the chosen codec through Vulkan Video. If none succeeds, it selects the corresponding software encoder and prints the reason. `--hw vulkan` follows the same selection and fallback policy. `--hw off` skips GPU probes.

With Vulkan encoding, a short decode-and-encode probe checks the source on the selected GPU. Supported sources use Vulkan decoding and scaling. If that probe fails, encoding stays on the GPU while decoding and scaling use software. Both probe types discard their output. HEVC and AV1 playback depends on the receiving application and device.

### Output handling and exit codes

Existing output is refused unless `--overwrite` is set. Source files and their symlink or hardlink aliases cannot be destinations. Encoding uses unique temporary output and statistics files; output is finalized after success, and failures or Ctrl-C remove temporary files. A dry run creates no files or directories; GPU probes write to the null device.

| Exit code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Success. |
| 2 | Input or usage error. |
| 3 | Missing FFmpeg or ffprobe. |
| 4 | Target too small for the duration. |
| 5 | Encoding failure. |
| 130 | Interrupted. |

Running without arguments prints usage and exits with code 2.

## Compatibility

The Python package and portable executable require Python 3.10 or newer and a compatible FFmpeg installation. A universal wheel does not establish that every platform has been tested. Native Linux builds also depend on the target system's C library.

Windows x64, Windows x86, Linux x64, and Linux x86 build routes are tested in GitHub Actions. Linux x86 uses Debian Bookworm i386 in a chroot on an x64 runner; CI verifies 32-bit Python, runs the test suite, and starts the built executable. Local Linux x86 execution is unavailable on the WSL 1 environment used for release preparation.

## Development

Install build tools and run checks from the repository root:

```text
python -m pip install build ".[build]"
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python -m build
python scripts/build_portable.py
python scripts/build_binary.py
python scripts/package_release.py
```

Outputs are written to `dist/`. Native builds use the operating system and pointer width of the Python interpreter running the script. A 32-bit build requires a 32-bit interpreter. Build Linux executables on the oldest Linux distribution you intend to support.

The native builder discovers CPython and PyInstaller licenses from the installed runtime and distribution metadata. For a custom Python installation, pass `--python-license PATH`. Supplemental dependency notices are supplied for Windows CPython 3.12.10/3.14.4 and discovered from Debian/Ubuntu system packages. Other runtimes require `--runtime-license-dir PATH`. Missing license files stop the build. `--clean` removes the repository's build outputs before rebuilding.

## Publishing to PyPI

Publishing a GitHub release runs [publish-pypi.yml](.github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml). It builds the wheel and source distribution, checks their metadata, tests the installed wheel, and uploads both packages through [PyPI Trusted Publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/).

### One-time setup

Create a PyPI account, verify its email address, and enable two-factor authentication. Under [Publishing](https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/), add a pending GitHub publisher with these values:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PyPI project name | `pressurecooker-video` |
| Owner | `maxie-maxie` |
| Repository | `pressurecooker` |
| Workflow filename | `publish-pypi.yml` |
| Environment | `pypi` |

The first upload creates the PyPI project. For an existing project, add the same publisher in its Publishing settings. GitHub creates the `pypi` environment when the publishing job runs. Authentication uses GitHub's identity token; an API token or repository secret is unnecessary.

### Publish a version

For the first release, keep version `0.1.0`. For subsequent releases, update both `pyproject.toml` and `src/pressurecooker/__init__.py`, then commit and push. The release tag must be `v` followed by that version.

From the repository root, publish the first GitHub release:

```text
gh release create v0.1.0 --target main --title "v0.1.0" --generate-notes
```

You can also publish a release from GitHub's Releases page. Drafts do not upload to PyPI. After the workflow succeeds, users can install with `pipx install pressurecooker-video`; FFmpeg and ffprobe remain separate requirements.

To check the workflow without uploading, run it manually from the Actions page or use:

```text
gh workflow run publish-pypi.yml --ref main
```

Manual runs build and test the packages, then skip publishing. PyPI versions cannot be replaced; use a new version for each later release.
